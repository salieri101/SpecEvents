"Rico"'s commands: /yea, /sing
Makes Rico laugh and sing

"VehOnFire"'s command: /cfire
Makes vehicles catch fire

"Simple Afkmode": Makes the player invulnerable AND frozen invisible when typing /afkon until the player types /afkoff i made it with frozen invisibility so that noob playaz wont be able to abuse it with only getting invulnerability in afkmode and still running around, and although playaz can open the buymenu but whatever they would buy while they are in /afkon they cant move with it so they cant abuse afkmode this way neither

"Simple Godmode": Makes the player invulnerable when typing /godon until the player types /godoff
