"Dish"'s commands: /dish1, /dish2, /dish3

"Tower"'s command: /tower

"Dome"'s commands: /dome1, /dome2, /dome3

"Mouth" is not finished / fixed yet and gives an error msg but its command is in the "Dome" 

"Rico"'s commands: /yea, /sing

"VehOnFire"'s command: /cfire

"Simple Afkmode":  it makes the player invulnerable AND frozen invisible when typing /afkon  until the player types /afkoff   i made it with frozen invisibility so that noob playaz wont be able to abuse it with only getting invulnerability in afkmode and still running around, and although playaz can open the buymenu but whatever they would buy while they are in /afkon  they cant move with it so they cant abuse afkmode this way neither

"Simple Godmode"  it makes the player invulnerable when typing /godon  until the player types /godoff
